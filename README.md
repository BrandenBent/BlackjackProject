# Jets Project

## Overview
This project is an assignment for the Skill Distillery FullStack Java Bootcamp focussing on Object Oriented Java programming.

The overall goal of this project is to solidify OOP concepts in the Java language while also using methods in order to prevent the Main method from seeming cluttered


## Implementation
This app uses multiple classes that either extend each other, while having two main "sections". A common section that creates a deck, shuffles, and acts as any normal 52 card deck, and blackjack section that uses all common methods and fields in order to create a game.

## Run Through
When the program is ran the user is welcomed is welcomed to the app and a deck of 52 cards is shuffled. Then the player plays through a game of Blackjack 1v1 with the dealer, afterward the player is asked if they would like to play again or exit the app

## Lessons Learned
This project implemented a lot more classes than I am used to and I struggled between deleting classes, creating new ones with larger scopes, all while keeping track of what what methods were usable in what classes. The concept of polymorphism was of particular note, in that I had many methods in this app with the same name in the same class, and learning to keep track of that was difficult to say the least.
